## Project Description and Objectives
This project aims to create a software-defined network using an RPi3 as a switch and implementing a Random Forest AI Model into the IDS for automated flood detection and blocking. Specifically, this project aims to:
- Interface a software-defined network using a Raspberry Pi 3 as a switch
- Train an Artificial Intelligence using the Random Forest Regression Model to detect ping floods
- Integrate the model into the Intrusion Detection System to block flooding and malicious connections
